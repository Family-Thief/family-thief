There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Bust up writers block ##
  > Get help on that piece that you're stuck on. 

## Summary ##
  > Inkwell is a collaborative writing platform.  It allows you to get help from a community of writers for any project you're on.  With a simple, intuitive interface and the features you need, InkWell has been designed for all kinds of writers to allow for a more enjoyable, frustration-free writing experience.  InkWell is inpsired by collaborative efforts, such as open-source-software, and brings the community driven experience to writing in a way that pushes writing into the new age.

## Problem ##
  > The problem is as old as writing itsef: writers block.  You're on a roll, but suddenly you're out of ideas and momentum.  Tough luck.

## Solution ##
  > InkWell provides you an environment to get some helpful suggestions on your writing.  A community of writers can help you move past your creative stopper and get you putting that story to paper once again.  It brings together those that need help with those that are willing to give it, and gives them a platform to share and celebrate these contributions with each other.  Ultimately, the project is the help-requester's, but now that writer has options not previously available.

## Quote from You ##
  > "We made InkWell to excell writing into the open-source era.  We saw that, as a whole, writing is a solitary effort, though there is no reason to not include the contributions of multiple writers in modern writing.  Imagine a book written by hundereds of writers?  What would that read like?  InkWell is a step in that direction." -Adam Van Antwerp, Scrum Master

## How to Get Started ##
  > Using InkWell is simple:  Just create a new user and log into the site.  From there, you are free to submit your own projects to get help with (called help-requests), or help other people on their projects and submit contributions.  The interface allows you to search for projects that might be interesting to you, or simply browse through the most recently submitted help requests.  From there the only limit is your creativity!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Writer's block sucks!  Now, I can get some ideas quickly and keep moving forward with my awesome story, while still maintaining owenership of the direction."  -Roger Harding, amateur author

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Aspiring authors can visit the site to get started, and curious developers can see all of our progress with the project on github, as the entire project is open source.
